# Bulk AI Image Generation

This Python script allows for bulk generation of images using the DALL-E API from OpenAI. You can provide a dataset with a list of prompts, and the script will call the DALL-E API for each item, generating images and saving the results to an output file.

**Code generated by ChatGPT (see prompt below)**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Requests library: You can install this library using `pip install requests`.
- An OpenAI API key: To get an API key, sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Usage

**Set** the `OPENAI_API_KEY` **env var**:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Run**


```sh
python3 icon-set-generate.py --datafile <datafile> --prompt <prompt>
```

* *datafile*: Path to your input dataset.    
This can be a .csv or .json file.    
If it is a CSV file, it must have headers for "name" and "desc".    
If it is a JSON file, it must have properties of "name" and "desc" for all elements to be included.    

* *prompt*: A main prompt string to be used in the image generation.

**Example**

```sh
python3 icon-set-generate.py --datafile all-tarot-cards.csv --prompt 'in a steampunk style, photorealistic, brightly coloured, highly detailed'
```

The output will be saved to output.csv or output.json depending on the input file format, and will contain the 'name', 'desc', and 'image_url' of the generated images.

## Code by ChatGPT

This program was generated by ChatGPT based on the following prompt:

```

I would like you to write me a command line program in python which will do the following:

Require 3 command line parameters, "--datafile" and "--prompt"
Both must be provided and if they are not then the program simply returns :
"
Usage: python3 icon-set-generate.py --datafile <datafile> --prompt <prompt>

The <datafile> can be a .csv file or a .json file.
If it is a CSV, it must have headers for "name" and "desc".
If it is a JSON file, it must have properties of "name" and "desc" for all elements to be included.

The <prompt> must be a single string.

eg. python3 icon-set-generate.py --datafile all-tarot-cards.csv --prompt 'in a steampunk style, photorealistic, brightly coloured, highly detailed'
"

If the <datafile> cannot be found then return: "<datafile> could not be found."

If we have a valid datafile and prompt then the next thing that happens is we check if the $OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set.  If it isn’t, then return: “OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set. To get your API key go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys”

If we have valid input and the env var, then we begin the program logic, it simply does this:

Read in the datafile.
For each entry:
1.set “prompt” to be: “an image of <data.name> (<data.desc>), <main-prompt>”
Where data.name and data.desc are what is read from the data file, and main-prompt is the --prompt parameter that was provided.
2. Call the DALL-E API, specify a size of 512x512 and n=1, wait asynchronous for the response, and then output it

The output should include the ‘name’ and ‘desc’ of the input datafile, but also have a ‘image_url’ property.
Note that the output should be in the same format as the input(so if it was a CSV then it will be necessary to output an initial life of “name,desc,image_url” for the headers).
```
